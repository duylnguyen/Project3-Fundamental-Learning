# PROJECT #3: Fundamental Coding

## Overview
For project #3, I choose to create a coding learning environment with simple challenges for people who want to learn basic coding. The users could solve the problems or create a problem which they can't sovle for others user's help. The answer are provided but recommend the users to try to solve it on their own. They could also leave the comments to ask more questions if they still don't understand the solutions for the problem.
